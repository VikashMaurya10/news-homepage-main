## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I'm using first time <ins>**Grid Css**</ins> properties to create responsive design & I'm glad to use these css properties. I realised in comparision to <ins>**Flex properties**</ins> , <ins>**Grid Css**</ins> is more useful to create responsive design.
- During completion of this project I learned little bit Grid properties but I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
  To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
}
```
> This code use to create responsive <ins>**Grid columns**</ins>. If any column has lessthen width <ins>**300px**</ins> then that column is auto shifted in another row.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for measuring the actual design. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
